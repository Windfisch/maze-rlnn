\section{Naive vs Episodic array learning}
Using the \verb+QArray+ function approximator, different training strategies can be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Immediately when a new $(\text{oldstate}, \text{action}, \text{newstate}, \text{reward})$ pair has been learned,
	update the $Q$ array by:
	$$Q_{\text{oldstate},\text{action}} = Q_{\text{oldstate},\text{action}} + \alpha \cdot (\text{reward} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\text{newstate},{a'}} - Q_{\text{oldstate},\text{action}})$$

	This is standard textbook reinforcement learning, and referred to as the "old" approach.

\item Alternatively, we can store the $(\text{oldstate}, \text{action}, \text{newstate}, \text{reward})$ pairs in an array,
	without instantly training them into out array. Then, at the end of an episode, we go through this list \emph{reversed}, and update as above.

	This has two effects:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item During an episode, we don't learn anything about former actions done during this episode
	\item At the end of an episode, a newly discovered path is completely learned, as opposed to the above approach, where for any newly discovered path only the last state before known terrain is learned.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the graphs, which show the total reward earned as a function of the episodes ran, we see, that the second ("new") approach converges to an equally good training result, however it gets good faster.

\begin{itemize}
	\item new: second approach as above
	\item old: first approach as above
	\item nn2: neuronal network with hidden layer with 50 neurons and sigmoidal-symmetric-stepwise-linear activation function
	\item nn: same as nn2, but with a friendlyness of $1$ instead of $0.7$
\end{itemize}

Note that the nn and nn2 runs get a reward of only $0.5$ for reaching the goal, while the old and new runs get $10$. Therefore, the nn/nn2 results have been multiplied by $20$ to make them comparable.
